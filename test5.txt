A wildfire, forest fire, or a bushfire is an unplanned, uncontrolled and unpredictable fire in an area of combustible vegetation.[1][2] Depending on the type of vegetation present, a wildfire may be more specifically identified as a bushfire (in Australia), desert fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, prairie fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire.[3] Some natural forest ecosystems depend on wildfire.[4] Modern forest management often engages in prescribed burns to mitigate fire risk and promote natural forest cycles. However, controlled burns can turn into wildfires by mistake.

Wildfires can be classified by cause of ignition, physical properties, combustible material present, and the effect of weather on the fire.[5] Wildfire severity results from a combination of factors such as available fuels, physical setting, and weather.[6][7][8][9] Climatic cycles with wet periods that create substantial fuels, followed by drought and heat, often precede severe wildfires.[10] These cycles have been intensified by climate change,[11]: 247  and can be exacerbated by curtailment of mitigation measures (such as budget or equipment funding), or sheer enormity of the event.

Wildfires are a common type of disaster in some regions, including Siberia (Russia), California, Washington, Oregon, Texas, Florida, (United States), British Columbia (Canada), and Australia.[12][13][14][15][16] Areas with Mediterranean climates or in the taiga biome are particularly susceptible. Wildfires can severely impact humans and their settlements. Effects include for example the direct health impacts of smoke and fire, as well as destruction of property (especially in wildland–urban interfaces), and economic losses. There is also the potential for contamination of water and soil.

At a global level, human practices have made the impacts of wildfire worse, with a doubling in land area burned by wildfires compared to natural levels.[11]: 247  Humans have impacted wildfire through climate change (e.g. more intense heat waves and droughts), land-use change, and wildfire suppression.[11]: 247  The carbon released from wildfires can add to carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere and thus contribute to the greenhouse effect. This creates a climate change feedback.[17]: 20 

Naturally occurring wildfires can have beneficial effects on those ecosystems that have evolved with fire.[18][19][20] In fact, many plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction.[21]

The ignition of a fire takes place through either natural causes or human activity (deliberate or not).


Lightning-sparked wildfires are frequent occurrences during the dry summer season in Nevada.
Natural causes
Natural occurrences that can ignite wildfires without the involvement of humans include lightning, volcanic eruptions, sparks from rock falls, and spontaneous combustions.[22][23]

Human activity
Sources of human-caused fire may include arson, accidental ignition, or the uncontrolled use of fire in land-clearing and agriculture such as the slash-and-burn farming in Southeast Asia.[24] In the tropics, farmers often practice the slash-and-burn method of clearing fields during the dry season.

In middle latitudes, the most common human causes of wildfires are equipment generating sparks (chainsaws, grinders, mowers, etc.), overhead power lines, and arson.[25][26][27][28][29]

Arson may account for over 20% of human caused fires.[30] However, in the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season "an independent study found online bots and trolls exaggerating the role of arson in the fires."[31] In the 2023 Canadian wildfires false claims of arson gained traction on social media; however, arson is generally not a main cause of wildfires in Canada.[32][33] In California, generally 6–10% of wildfires annually are arson.[34]

Coal seam fires burn in the thousands around the world, such as those in Burning Mountain, New South Wales; Centralia, Pennsylvania; and several coal-sustained fires in China. They can also flare up unexpectedly and ignite nearby flammable material.[35]
